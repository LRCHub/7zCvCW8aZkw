```lrc
[00:51.81] Who really knows what rights all the wrongs anyway?
[00:57.16] Who really cares what people do or say?
[01:01.58] And no matter where this life takes me
[01:03.79] I'll never let it compromise
[01:07.07] Too much luck to bet it on do or die
[01:25.07] 
[01:11.00] 'Cause I've seen everything that I could see
[01:16.03] And now I can say goodbye today
[01:21.31] With all I know, it's time I said goodbye
[01:27.11] Today is a good day to die
[01:40.11] 
[01:32.28] Lived by the rules that you gave me and fell apart
[01:36.70] All the wrong turns down a dead end street so far
[01:41.55] I stretched my wings and breathe in a different day
[01:46.85] Alone and broke is the price I pay, but that's okay
[02:12.35] 
[01:51.85] I've seen everything that I could see
[01:56.15] And now I can say goodbye today
[02:01.48] With all I know, it is time I said goodbye
[02:07.52] Today is a good day to die
[02:20.52] 
[02:15.62] Never thought in my life
[02:20.33] Taking all I can take
[02:25.18] It's time to say goodbye
[02:28.33] It's a good day to die
[02:39.33] 
[03:01.90] 'Cause I've seen everything that I could see
[03:06.32] And now I can say goodbye today
[03:12.03] With all I know, it's time I said goodbye
[03:17.78] Today is a good day to die
[03:30.78] 
[03:22.27] 'Cause I've seen everything
[03:24.65] And I know all I know
[03:27.29] It's time I said goodbye today
[03:32.33] With all I know, it's time I said goodbye
[03:38.07] Today is a good day to die
