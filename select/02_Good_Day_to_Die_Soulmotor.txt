Sank to my knees when the man said Jesus saves
Dropped my coin in the plate when the man said pay
And the sky is calling and I think today's the day
A good day to die

Scrawled on the wall is a sign says God is dead
Can't seem to stop this revelation song in my head
And the sky is falling and I think today's the day
A good day to die

One way one truth I just don't believe it anymore
One law one rule I just don't believe it anymore

Staked to the cross with a fistful of coffin nails
Thrown to the wolves in the end cause it's all the same
And the sky is crawling and I think today's the day
A good day to die
