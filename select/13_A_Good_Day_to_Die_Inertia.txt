I think one days worth a lifetime
When you've got nothing to lose
But Ive been thinking this whole time that I had something to prove
I think today is a good day to die
I think today is the last time ill say goodbye
I know the timing might not be right
But this losing fight is getting the best of me
How would you know when you flow right through me?
Your words like daggers they rip through every memory
My words I cannot speak
I cannot breathe my bane against you
I think one days worth a lifetime
When you've got nothing to lose
But Ive been thinking this whole time that I had something to prove
I think today is a good day to die
I think today is the last time ill say goodbye
I know the timing might not be right
But this losing fight is getting the best of me
Take these words down with you, into the core of your own soul
I know your bodies aching for someone to call your own
Take these words down with you, and one day your soul ill find
I know your bodies aching to show the world that you are mine
Free the world inside your own mind
Free the world inside your own mind
I think one days worth a lifetime
When you've got nothing to lose
But Ive been thinking this whole time that I had something to prove
I think today is a good day zto die
I think today is the last time ill say goodbye
I know the timing might not be right
But this losing fight is getting the best of me
I think today is the last time ill say goodbye
