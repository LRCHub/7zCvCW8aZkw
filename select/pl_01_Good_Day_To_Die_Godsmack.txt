Who really know what rights all the wrongs
anyway
Who really cares what people do or say
No matter where this life takes me
Ill never let it compromise
To much luck to bet it on do or die
Cause I've seen everything that I could see
And now I can say goodbye today
With all I know
Its time I said goodbye
Today is a good day to die
Lived by the rules you that you gave me and fell
apart
All the wrong turns down a dead end street so
far
I stretched my wings and breath in different day
Alone and broken is the price I pay
But that's OK
I've seen everything that I could see
And now I can say goodbye today
With all I know
Its time I said goodbye
Today is a good day to die
Never thought life?
Taking all I can take
It's time to say goodbye
It's a good day to die
Cause I've seen everything that I could see
And now I can say goodbye today
With all I know
Its time I said goodbye
Today is a good day to die
